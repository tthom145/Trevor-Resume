<h2>Fastenal Company</h2>
<p>Fastenal is one of the largest construction and commercial parts distrubiters in the country. With over 2,000 locations, you can almost find them in every decent sized city across the country.
    I held positions at two locations in my area during my employment. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Paducah, KY
        <p>I started my employment in Paducah as an Inside Salesman. This position is where I learned the processes of inventory management and logistics. I also learned how to communicate with customers in a retail style environment. While I was here, I helped to receive and stage parts for our outside salesmen to deliver to their customers.
            We dealt with anything from the smallest nuts and bolts all the way to pallets of water. By the end of my time in Paducah, I was going out on my own practicing the role of an outside salesman in a small caliber.

     <li>Calvert City, Ky
        <p>After a few years in Paducah, I was given the opportunity to move into an official outside sales role at a sister store 30 minutes away. While in this role, I managed a book of clients totaling over 100. I spent my days traveling on site to customers and making phone calls letting them know of any new products that were out.
           I also managed inventory levels for a number of products on site. I would check storage bins and cabinets to order product as needed to make sure they had what they needed. This job taught me that organization and assertiveness can make all the difference no matter what field of work I am in.
