<h2>Hutson Inc.</h2>
<p>Hutson is a licensed entity for the John Deere Company. We did everything from sales all the way down to the smallest
    parts needed to run a combine or planter. We also sold Stihl machines and parts used by
    local yard care companies for maintaining their line of lawncare and landscaping business.</p>

    <li type="A">While at this company, I started working in the parts warehouse where I would use electronic inventory
        software to receive and store parts. Along with this, I would have to do regular inventory checks to make sure
        our numbers were correct so that our customers had what they needed
        at any given time. While in this role, I would also call customers to let them know their parts were in for pick
        up or work with our service department to schedule deliveries or installs.
    </li>
    <li type="A">Once I had a chance to move up, I stepped up to the parts counter position. This is where I learned how to
        source parts from multiple vendors. This move also allowed me to use my face-to-face customer service skills to
        boost sales and create happy customers.
