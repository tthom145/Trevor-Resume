<h2>CorrecTek Inc.</h2>
        <p>We are an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) software vendor based out of Paducah, KY. We cater to a multitude of
            clients in the correctional field such as county jails all the way to whole state DOC's.
            I have two main roles within the company that I facilitate on a normal basis.</p>
        <ol>
            <li type="A">The first role that I play is tech and software support for our many clients. I answer phones and
                assist with clients who have issues with the software. This could be anything from building reports to checking
                to make sure the interface(s) between us and the other entities are communicating correctly.
                I also assist with modification or the building of templates within the software that is specific to the
                clients' needs at the time. </li>
            <li type="A">My other responsibility is a trainer for our software. This part of my position calls for
                me training new users on the use and navigation of our software. Since I have started, I have trained
                clients both on site and remotely. This has allowed me to utilize my understanding of software and people skills
                to make sure the users are fully capable of doing what they need when they are done training.
                We show them everything from entering patients to performing daily tasks for their follow up care.
            </li>
        </ol>
