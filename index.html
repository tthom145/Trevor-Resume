	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am happily married and a father of hree. I have two boys and a girl who was born back in August of 2024. My oldest will be 10 in a few short weeks, and our middle child just turned two in December. I am someone who enjoys learning and who is always willing to work hard to make things happen. I enjoy people, and I've been able to use that along with my desire for work to build my career. <br>
