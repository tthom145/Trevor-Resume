<h2>Fastenal Company</h2>
<p>Fastenal is one of the largest construction and commercial parts distrubiters in the country. With over 2,000 locations,you can almost find them in every decent sized city across the country.
    I held positions at two locations in my area during my employment. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Paducah, KY
        <p>I started my employment in Paducah as an Inside Salesman. This position is where I learned inventory management and the logistics process. I also learned how to deal with customers in a retail style environment. While I was here, I help[ed to receive and stage parts for our outside salesmen to deliver to their customers.
            We dealt with anything from teh smallest nuts and bolts all the way to pallets of water. Once I got some footing here, by the time I ended my time at this location, I would go into the field and deliver/stock the parts that the salesmen were ordering.

     <li>Calvert City, Ky
        <p>After a few years in Paducah, I wa sgiven the opportunity to move into an outside sales role at a sister store 30 minutes away. While in this role, I managed a book of clients totaling over 100. I spent my days traveling on site to customers and making phone calls letting them know of any new products that were out.
           I also managed inventory levels for a numbe of products on site. I would do inventory and order product as needed to make sure they had what they needed. This job taught me a lot about being organized and present for client's needs.
